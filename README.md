##  **1. The Beginning** :airplane:
### **1.1 Brainstorming ideas** :brain:
After we have recieved the prompt, we decided to have a brain storm of ideas. The ideas we came up with are: 

* **Offline entertainment platform** that allows people to download movies etc :movie_camera:
* **Luggage tracker** :briefcase:
* **Amber alarm** - any car accidents, crimes occuring in a certain area will give the traveller a notification on their device :alarm_clock:
* **Carbon footprint tracker** from the use of  transport :recycle:
* **Exchange rate and inflation tracker** :bar_chart:
* **Travel companion chat bot** :robot:
* **Local events aggregator** :satellite:
* **AI powered parking and travel route optimiser** :red_car:


### **1.2 Synopsis of our most feasible idea** :bulb: :
During covid, unemployment rate and inflation increased drastically, and as a result, people's disposable income also decreased. This meant that for the average individuals, there is less incentive for people to travel. However, during this period, the richest in the world had their wealth almost doubled causing an income imbalance. 

As the pandemic reaches to an end, people are eager to travel, but due to the state of economy after covid, rich people are left lonely with no one to travel with and average people don't have the propensity to spend on travelling. This problem gave us the idea to initially come up with the idea of an "e-begging" platfrom, where we match rich people who are looking for friends to travel with to poorer people that are looking to get a cheaper trip. 

However, we soon realised we are capable of making this platform reach a much broader target audience than just rich matching the poor, so we decided to make a general "buddy-buddy" platform for everyone regardless of financial status. However, we still decided to use the rich and poor example in our demostration.

## **2. What is OnlyGuests**

After we have finalised the idea, we decided to name our project: **"project OnlyGuests"**
### **2.1 Features included** :wrench: 
Due to the 24 hour time constraint, our group decided that beofore we start coding, we need to finalise the minimum required amount of features included in our porject. These features are:

* **Log in/registration feature** :mailbox_closed:
* **Email duplicate checking feature** :mag: 
* **Ability to create travel session as a host** :dizzy:
* **Ability to join travel session as a guest** :walking:
* **Ability to automatically filter out sessions according to your selected tags** 
* **Ability to matach session with users** :ok_hand:
* **Ability for guests to rate hosts** :star:

These features are selected so that it is feasible for this project to be completed in time while also showing a high degree of technical complexity.

## **3. Putting it all together**
### **3.1 Coding** :computer:
#### **3.1.1 Tech stack (back end)**


* Python
* Flask

#### **3.1.2 Front end**

* React.JS
* Typescript
* Framer motion
* Tailwind
### **3.2 Presentation** :tv:
Simultaneously, we are working on the presentation slides and the script. For this we decided to go for a comedic approach to catch the audience's attention and differentiate ourselves from the rest. For example, we incorporated a plethora of **memes, funny images and blunt language** :joy:. Then we worked on the script based off of the slides and tried to shorten it to 30-40 seconds to give it enough time for demonstration.


#### How to Run:
Set up two terminals, in one `cd` into `/backend` and `/frontend` in the other. Run `python3 server.py` for the former and `npm install` and `npm run dev` for the latter.
